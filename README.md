## Netflix Data Analysis Project â€“ Using SQL
This project involves comprehensive analysis of a Netflix dataset that was previously cleaned. Columns containing multiple values were correctly parsed using SQL queries, making the data model more organized and easier to analyze, resulting in a consistent and relational structure. Detailed queries were written to answer many questions, ranging from newly added content to the actors with the most roles.
